How to set up the project
1. make sure you have node js installed
2. compile application and run

Disclaimer, I ran out of time. 
The code you are about to review is mediocre.

with more time i would do the following 
- make the react code generic
- make unit tests for react code and c# code
- add a real database rather than an in memory repository
